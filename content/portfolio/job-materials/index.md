For this assignment, we were instructed to find a job listing and prepare job materials that could be used to apply for the position. The first part is the resume, which should highlight our relevant experience and skills for the job. The second part was a cover letter, which presents an opportunity to expand upon our experience outside of the resume and elaborate upon the qualities which make us a strong candidate for the job. Lastly, we were asked to create a short mini interview video that includes our background and a specific past experience that relates to the position.

Since I already had a resume that I had been using to apply for jobs, I adapted the resume for the job posting. For my cover letter, I elaborated on my team project that used React and AWS, since these were both listed in the requirements section for my chosen job listing. I also expanded on my previous internship experience at MITRE, including additional details about my project and my role on the team. The fact that I used Python and demonstrated ability to work and communicate with a team also addressed specific parts of the job listing.

In the video mini interview, I chose to talk about the team project I had done, and specifically our strategy to meet regularly in order to plan and assign tasks as needed in order to complete the necessary features by the project deadline. I also briefly touched on my educational background and additional programming skills.

When revising my resume, I adjusted some of the wording and minor details like graduation date. I also revamped the personal project section by adding a new project that better demonstrates my skills and ordering the projects in reverse chronological order. For my cover letter, I revised the wording to strengthen my argument and transferred it to a webpage for better accessibility. (I would have liked to do the same for my resume, but given the particular nature of the formatting, I decided it was best to keep it as a PDF.)
