The assignment for this project was to create a set of written instructions that describe how to carry out a task of our choosing. Along with 800-1000 total words of text, the instructions were to include illustrations that help demonstrate and elaborate upon the text content. An emphasis was placed on clarity, specificity, and readability.

When I was deciding on a topic for these instructions, I had been intensely researching solar eclipses in anticipation of viewing the April 8th, 2024 total solar eclipse. Therefore, I knew I would have no shortage of knowledge on the topic. In fact, the hardest part of this assignment was refining the scope of the instructions to balance the amount and density of information presented within.

I created the instructions for a reader who is already wanting to view a solar eclipse, but may not be informed about concepts like the path of totality or solar eye safety. In the instructions, I provide some background information on eclipses and instructions for getting information about the eclipse at a given location, obtaining safe eclipse glasses, and safely observing the eclipse itself. I also captured website screenshots and created custom illustrations to guide to reader through the process.

Revising my instructions involved both removing unnecessary repeated elements and elaborating upon my existing material. I started my removing repeated headers and headings across all pages. Then, I made some extra room on the first page so that I could describe the types of eclipses at the bottom. On page 2, I added more background information and explained the image I created, and I cited my source for the eclipse dates. On pages 3-5 I added more detail to my instructions to make it easier to follow along. On the sixth page, I moved some of the content into a warning box and specified where on the glasses to look for the safety certifications. Finally, I added a brief conclusion to the last page.
