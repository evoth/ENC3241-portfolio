Since this project was a group project, I worked with three other students to plan and write this proposal. The purpose of this project was to write a persuasive proposal as if we were going to conduct a research study on a topic of our choosing. The proposal was required to include multiple sections that covered the various aspects of the proposed research question, building a case for the acceptance and funding of the study. There were also word length requirements in order to simulate similar strict requirements that may be imposed in the professional and academic workplace.

The first step was to decide on a topic for our proposal. We all had overlapping interests, and the use of technology to improve education stood out as something that we would all be interested in researching and writing about. Initially, our research question was about using computer vision to improve the integrity of online tests at UCF. However, after feedback from our instructor, we chose to pivot to a new topic due to the existence of tools that perform a similar function to our original topic. The new proposal would be to create personalized learning assistants for students using generative AI technology similar to ChatGPT.

We gathered research articles surrounding the intersection between generative AI and education, then chose the most relevant articles to inform and provide evidence for our proposal. Then, we collaborated to write the various sections of the proposal, revising and expanding upon each other's work as we went. Finally, we made finishing touches to flow and formatting.

In revising the proposal, I made many changes to improve the argument and flow of the document. In many areas, I increased the specificity of the planned study and products. I added details on how the initial student survey will be conducted, how the language model will be trained, and the specifics of the pricing in each case. I also elaborated on how we will share our findings if they prove to be positive, and further steps for implementing the technology. Lastly, I improved the formatting and cut down some sections so that they complied with the given word limits.
