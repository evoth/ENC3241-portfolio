To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Development Intern position at the Colorado Springs location, as posted on your website. As a third-year Computer Science student with a demonstrated personal motivation for learning about and using new technologies, whether in my personal or professional projects, I believe that my skills, experience, and desire to grow will enable me to make a meaningful contribution towards Keysightâ€™s mission of connecting and securing the world.

Throughout my education at the University of Central Florida, I have gained an in-depth understanding of a variety of computer science topics, from data structures and algorithms to object-oriented programming, to databases and various web technologies. Additionally, I have completed numerous class projects, including working on an 8-person Agile team to create a full-stack household management website and app using the Amazon Amplify ecosystem with React and React Native. Working on these projects has improved my ability to effectively collaborate with teammates and express ideas to people with various levels of experience.

During my internships at MITRE, I have had the opportunity to investigate the use of generative AI to accelerate implementation of algorithms and to develop a Python prototype of an improved satellite detection algorithm utilizing ground-based telescope imagery. In my roles as an intern, I worked on a team that provides information to the Space Force to utilize when making decisions about government funding of software upgrades for observatory sites. At the end of each project, I had the opportunity to present my findings to other members of the team, which gave me valuable experience in communicating my work to people with various levels of area expertise.

I am excited at the prospect of working as a Full Stack Development Intern at Keysight, which would allow me to utilize my current technological and interpersonal skills towards making a positive impact in my role, as well as further developing my teamwork skills and knowledge of full stack technologies. I believe I would be a perfect fit for this internship and would welcome the opportunity to speak further about this opportunity. Thank you for your time and consideration; for next steps, I can be reached at (719) 394-6704 or ethanvoth1@gmail.com.

Sincerely,
